              http://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms.html depending on your compatible

            <strong>API</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We may provide access to the API as part of the Services for no additional fee. Subject
            to the other terms of this agreement, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,

          </p>
          <p>
            You must not use the API in a manner, as reasonably determined by us, that exceeds
            reasonable request volume or constitutes excessive or abusive usage. If any of these
            occur, we can suspend or terminate your access to the API on a temporary or permanent
            basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will maintain and provide access to the API, unless we terminate the API for all
            customers with notice for any reason, including where it is not technically feasible or
            economically viable to continue granting access to the API.
          </p>
          <p>
            The API is provided on an &lsquo;AS IS&rsquo;, &lsquo;WHERE IS&rsquo; and &lsquo;WHEN
            AVAILABLE&rsquo; basis. We have no liability to you as a result of any change, temporary

          </p>
          <p>
            Your use of the Services and use of and access to any RestSpace Content does not grant
            or transfer any rights, title or interest to you in relation to the Services or the
            RestSpace Content. However we do grant you a licence to access the Services and view the

            applicable, as expressly authorised by us and/or our third party licensors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any reproduction or redistribution of any of the Services or the RestSpace Content is

          <p>
            <strong>Customer Content</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            You retain all right, title, and interest in any Content that you provide to us in
            connection with the your use of the Services, and any results derived from the use of
            such Content (&lsquo;Customer Content&rsquo;). Customer Content excludes any feedback,
            suggestions, or requests for improvements that you provide to us.
          </p>
           <p>
            You hereby grants us and our licensors (as the case requires) a non-exclusive,
            non-transferable, royalty-free, sub-licensable, worldwide right to host, run, and
            reproduce Customer Content solely for the purpose of enabling the your use, and other
            users&rsquo; use, of the Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without your permission, we will not access, use, or disclose Customer Content except as
            reasonably necessary to support your use of the Services, or for any other purpose
            authorised by you in writing. If you access any Service with an application provided by
            a third party, we may disclose Customer Content to such third party as necessary to
            enable interoperation between the application, the Service, and the Customer Content. We
            may disclose Customer Content if required to do so by law or regulation or by order of a
            court or other government body, in which case we will reasonably attempt to limit the
            scope of disclosure. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that your Customer Content
            is suitable for use with the Services and for maintaining regular offline backups, as
            applicable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon termination of your right to use or access the Services, we will make your Customer
            Content available to you on request for a period of 30 days, unless you request a
            shorter window of availability, or we are legally prohibited from doing so. Thereafter,
            your right to access or use your Customer Content with the Services will end, and we
            will have no further obligations to store or return your Customer Content.
          </p>
          <p>You warrant that your Customer Content does not:</p>
          
            <br/>
              contain any vulgar, obscene, indecent or unlawful material, including material that is

              or limit the functionality of any computer software, hardware, or telecommunications
              equipment;
            
            <br/>
              violate any law or regulation;

              rights of privacy or publicity) unless you have all necessary rights and consents to
              do so;
            
            <br/>
              infringe or misappropriate the rights of any third party;
            
            <br/>
              defame or libel us, our employees, other individuals or users of the Services; or

              property, including a third party&#39;s accounts, domain names, URLs, websites, networks,
              systems, facilities, equipment, data, other information, or business operations.
            
          
          <p>
            We may remove or delete any portions of your Customer Content if there is reason to
            believe that uploading the Customer Content to, or using it with, any or all of the
            Services materially violates these terms of use, including Restrictions on Use. If
            reasonable under these circumstances, we will notify you before removing your Customer
            Content. Except as set out in these terms of use, we take no responsibility for any
            Customer Content uploaded by any user to any of the Services.

            You indemnify us against all costs and liability incurred by us as a result of our
            possession, processing, use or other handling of any of your Customer Content,
            documentation or records, except to the extent that such costs and liability arise as a
            result of our breach of these terms of use.
